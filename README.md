## Levels [todo]

The character you play as has a certain level. Leveling up is achieved by gaining xp. Once you level up you will be rewarded with items, coins or more xp.
The character also has skills which level up and give rewards in the same fashion.

## Tasks [todo]

Tasks can be added to the game to achieve XP. Each task should give XP based on how difficult it is. There could also be tasks that don't reward XP, but rather reward in gold coins.
Tasks are linked to a skill.

## Shop [todo]

The coins that are received by leveling up can be used to buy dispensable and permanent items. These items can boost xp gain or increase rewards. Items can also be sold for coins.
